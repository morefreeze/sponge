I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [list sunetids here]

This lab took me about 2 hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the StreamReassembler:
[]

Implementation Challenges:
[]

Remaining Bugs:
[]

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [describe]
I struggle with capacity because I had no idea what I should do when out of capacity.
So I read failed test to help me understand this. I felt I'm hacking tests somehow.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]
I believed I didn't understand emplace and move operator perfectly, so that I may
improve my code efficiency by using them correctly.

- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]
I was surprised by so many tests to ensure my code was right. These give me much
confident.

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
I'm not sure I implement all interface of ByteStream correctly, I wish I wouldn't
modify any code in later lab.
