Lab 0 Writeup
=============

My name: [your name here]

My SUNet ID: [your sunetid here]

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

This lab took me about 3 hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: [code here]

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [describe]
I tried to return error when write overflow but I found I don't need do that.
After I failed some tests I found it's ok I just use simply iterator to read
or write string. That makes thing easier.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]
I may use memcpy to reduce iterator to constant operation but it will make
thing more complex(I need process corner case carefully)

- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]
test cases are in good organization and output detail to help me identify
wrong line. That really impress me a lot.

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
